# TradeTronic

## Goals:

- Create a stock trading tool which enables human and machine analysis using only open source python modules,
- Remove my dependency on Amibroker and Excel from my trading routine,
- Write it completely in python,
- Establish my first well-tuned neural network from scratch (chart-reader tool),
- Open source it all,
- Use locally run neural networks, only,
- Get proficient with SW lifecycles on my own

## Constraints
- Dependent on Norgate EOD data,
- Only considering daily data for now,
- Ensure dataframes are usable for a machine learning basis later on

## Modules:
TATools.py: Contains all the functions for accessing an manipulating stock data
GUI.py: Renders the bokeh html
y_SysInt_Tests.py: My sandbox to try the above modules

See modules for functional summaries.
